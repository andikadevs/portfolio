        I have a lot of hobbies, actually. I love to play the <span className="text-accent">guitar</span> and 
        perform many songs during my free time <span className="text-accent">I suggest you not to 
        listen :</span> I also enjoy watching movies, reading novels, 
        and such. And, of course, I like to level up my skills!
